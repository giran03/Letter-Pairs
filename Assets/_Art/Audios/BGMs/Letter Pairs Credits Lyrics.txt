Letter Pairs Song for Credits Lyrics

[Verse]
Cards on the table flip them around
Match up the letters feel the sound
A A B B and C C
Let's find the pairs so easily

[Verse 2]
First one's a P and next one's an R
Shuffle the deck won't go too far
Turn them over watch and see
Practice your ABCs with me

[Chorus]
Letter Pairs shuffle around
Find your match and feel the sound
A to Z let's get those pairs
Learning letters fun to share

[Bridge]
Eyes on the board concentration
Match them up no hesitation
Playing games learning fast
This is knowledge that will last

[Verse 3]
V and W getting close
Every pairing we diagnose
Keep on flipping one by one
Learning letters having fun

[Chorus]
Letter Pairs shuffle around
Find your match and feel the sound
A to Z let's get those pairs
Learning letters fun to share
